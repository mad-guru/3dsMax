chappal:
currently no rig cut version.

is created after rest of rig setup..then run chpl functions to bring in scene file etc

create bones, let it align pt to toe, then resize chappal using edit mesh.
align pts to origin. delete rigs and leave only pts and top and btm chappal geometry

save selected out to file and then run it again.

you can even load envelopes and fix them then save out and run again on fresh scene.
